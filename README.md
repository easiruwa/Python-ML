# Python-ML - Data Fusion Program of Multiple Physiological Sensors

This program will allow the user to run Symbolic Aggregate Approximation   
and other miscellaneous Machine Learning techniques on data sets from      
multiple physiological sensors, specifically: fNIRS, EEG, EDA, ECG, and   
Respiration. See the attatched Manual for additional instructions.
